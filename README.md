### Browser Support

The following browsers are **supported** (issues will be prioritized):
- **Chromium**: `110+`
- **Firefox**: `110+`
- **Safari**: `16+`
- **IE**: None.

The following browsers will very likely work, but are not officially supported:

- **Safari**: `12+`
- **IE**: None.

Other browsers may work, but are not guaranteed to.

## Performance

### JavaScript

The **total** JavaScript bundle size is less than `1000 kB`, but this is made even smaller by the fact that the bundle is split into multiple files, and only the necessary files are loaded on each page.

### Benchmarks

## Installation

Versia-FE is included in the provided `docker-compose` file during [Versia Server installation](https://github.com/versia-pub/server/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

To have Versia-FE and Versia Server running on the same domain, edit the Versia Server configuration to point to the Versia-FE container's address (`frontend` category inside config).

### Manual Installation

Here are the steps to install Versia-FE manually:

#### Docker/Podman

```yaml
services:
    fe:
        image: ghcr.io/versia-pub/frontend:main
        container_name: versia-fe
        restart: unless-stopped
        networks:
            - versia-net
```

Then, the frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` inside the container.

> [!TIP]
>
> By default, Versia-FE will connect to any Versia Server instance running on the same domain.
>
> You can set the `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST` environment variable to point to a different Versia Server instance.

#### Manual

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/versia-pub/frontend.git
```
2. Install dependencies.
```bash
bun install
```
3. Build the project.
```bash
bun run build
```
4. Serve the static files in the `.output/public` directory.
> [!WARNING]
> 
> `.output/public/200.html` should be configured as a fallback for all 404 errors.
